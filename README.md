# WEB103 Project 3 - **Event Explorer**

Submitted by: **Tanishq V. Todkar**

About this web app: **Event Explorer is a web application that allows users to view and explore various events happening at different locations. Users can select a location and view all corresponding events, complete with event details such as time, date, and a countdown timer for upcoming events.**

Time spent: **20** hours

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The web app uses React to display data from the API**
- [x] **The web app is connected to a PostgreSQL database, with an appropriately structured Events table**
  - [x] **NOTE: Your GIF or a screenshot added to this README must include a view of your Railway database that shows the contents of the table used by your app**
- [x] **The web app displays the title of the app**
- [x] **A visual interface allows the user to select a Location they would like to view**
- [x] **Clicking on a Location shows a list of all items from the Events table that corresponds to that Location**
- [x] **Each Location detail page should have its own unique URL**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [] An additional page shows all possible `Events` that the user can sort and filter by `Location`
- [] `Events` display a countdown showing the time remaining before that event and appears with different formatting when the event has passed

## Notes
- The file structuring and giving half code was super bad. The Event.jsx with its own half baked functions was even worse. Should have had given atleast the dates.js that converts everything.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented required features:
